<h1 style="color:darkgreen;font-size: 50px">Buy your color a thank you card</h1>
<p style="width: 50%;font-family: papyrus">I've never been in love
But I do like Green
I have a Green bag, Green plant, Green shoes, and shirt again
I bought them solely because they're green
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-family:papyrus">A relationship since I could grasp grass
It's practically a celebrity
Green was quite the nemesis
Hot vomit on the side of the yellow brick road
That used to be my green
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;font-family:papyrus">People don't reminisce with colors
I wonder if there’s is a secret life
it never shares with us
Our humane affinity
to a particular path of light
like a cute little milky way
spinning around, obeying gravity
</p>

<p style="text-align: right;width: 50%;font-family:papyrus">I've reached the emerald city
Green is plush and fluid now
My green is plush and fluid
Your green could be June
But mine looks at me like a hug
that's too long and then too short
I wonder if there’s is a secret life
it never shares with us
</p>
